# Signal and Image Processing with Python

## Introduction

Welcome to this repository! This repo contains a basic starting guide for using Python to perform signal and image processing. Whether you're new to this field or looking for a refresher, you'll find essential tools and examples to help you get started.

## Befor Starting 

The envirenement setup folder contains installation guide to setup the envirenement work to have the essential tools to perform the needed taskes.

- Introduction to Python
- An installation guide of Python on diferent operating systems 
- Lazy guide to setup the envirenement work
- Configration of the IDLE (Spdeyr)
- Managing Envirements

## Getting Started 
The second  folder contains the essential libraries to perform the needed processing.
**/!\/**: Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed [see link](https://github.com/Mo-h-S/Python-for-SP-and_IP/tree/a14012be2a51c8fde4cf5dfaedc67aa7214c0dd2/Work_environnement_setup) . 
The primary libraries used are:
  ### libraries for data manipulation
   - NumPy / Pandas
   - Matplotlib
  ### library for signal processing
   - SciPy
  ### libraries for Image processing
   - Scikit-image
   - OpenCV

In addition to examples of:
- Signal Processing
  - Generating and analyzing signals
  - Fourier transforms
- Image Processing
  - Reading and displaying images
  - Basic image transformations (grayscale conversion, blurring)
