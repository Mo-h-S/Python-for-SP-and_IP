## MATLAB to Python

Historically, MATLAB has long been the tool of choice for signal and image processing in academic and industrial environments. However, recent years have seen a significant transition towards Python. This evolution can be explained by several factors:

1.The increasing accessibility of Python
2. The development of powerful and specialized libraries
3. The open-source nature of Python
4. Its versatility in various fields of computer science and data science

This repository focuses on two main aspects of this transition:

## 1. Transition from MATLAB to Python

This section addresses the key differences between MATLAB and Python, thus facilitating the transition for users accustomed to MATLAB. Essential points include:

- **Syntactic differences** :
  - Structure of loops and conditions
  - Declaration and use of functions
  - Array indexing (starting at 0 in Python, at 1 in MATLAB)

- **Data types** :

  - Lists, tuples, and dictionaries in Python vs matrices in MATLAB
  - Manipulation of multidimensional arrays with NumPy
  - Management of complex data structures
  - Comparisons with equivalent MATLAB functions, where applicable

## The MATLAB/Python Transition

With MATLAB, we can create vectors and arrays of numbers or text, which are intuitive and quite useful. Essentially, we can access any value in a vector or matrix based on its position (e.g., list(1,2)). With Python, in addition to lists, we discover different and very powerful structures, such as dictionaries. Dictionaries are data structures that can be accessed by the "key" of the value and not by its position in the structure. Want to know its usefulness? In a phone book, which would be easier: finding numbers by position in the list or by the contact's name? :D Moreover, there is a distinction between decimal numbers (float) and integers. That's why it's better to first familiarize yourself with the existing variable types and structures in Python! It's a considerable advantage.
