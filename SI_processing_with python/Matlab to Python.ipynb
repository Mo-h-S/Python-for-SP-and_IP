    "Note that the indentation inserted is optional, it is just a good practice.\n",
    "Indentation means that blocks of your code are marked with a space to identify what is nested in the code. In the example below, the four spaces before the statement on line 6 indicate that this statement is nested (i.e. inside) the loop shown on line 5 (without indentation).\n",

The end is indicated by the end of the indentation at line 7. The interpreter sees that line 7 is not nested in the loop started at line 5 and, therefore, does not consider this line as part of the block. In this way, it is obvious that the indentation, in this case, is not optional but mandatory!"
